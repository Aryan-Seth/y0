# Statement of need

> Clearly illustrate the research purpose of the software and places it in the context of related work.

1. What's the point of causal inference? Referencing some Pearl and Barenboim papers.
2. Tasks you can accomplish:
   - estimate causal effect
   - ask "what if" questions related to interventions and counterfactuals
3. What are some of the high-level problems that it solves? Give general feel as well as a few specific examples to
   motivate the case studies/demonstration later.

Issues we need to solve:

1. Reusable implementations of algorithms
2. Components of algorithms that can serve as building blocks for future algorithms
3. Implementation of DSL for probabilistic expressions and mixed graph data structure

# Future direction

1. What are some algorithmic limitations that need more research? E.g., estimation of multiple outcomes
2. What are some parts of a fully automatable causal workflow we haven't been able to do?
    - We can do identification and generation of an estimand, but only estimate the estimand in a small number of cases.
      What are some forward-looking ways to overcome this?
        - Pyro [@bingham2018pyro] and ChiRho [https://github.com/BasisResearch/chirho]
        - Tractable Circuits [@darwiche2022causalinferenceusingtractable]
3. What are some high-priority algorithms to implement on our to-do list, and why are they important?
    - cyclic ID (ioID) [@forr√©2019causalcalculuspresencecycles]
    - gID [@lee2019general]
    - gID* [@correa2021counterfactual]
    - Data ID [@nabi2020dataid]
    - Good and bad controls [@cinelli2022crash]
