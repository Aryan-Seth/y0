    "# Axes of Query Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "* **model transformation complexity** ranging from simple queries over Pearl’s causal hierarchy (association and intervention) to complex queries (multiple world counterfactuals)\n",
    "* **simulation complexity**, ranging from unconditional (forward simulation) queries to conditional queries (inverse problem)\n",
    "* **decision complexity**, ranging from simple decisions (compare A vs B) to sophisticated decisions “optimize $f(x, u)$ subject to $g(x, u) = 0, h(x, u) \\leq 0$\n",
    "* **intervention complexity**, In general, interventions that modify Petri nets are guaranteed to generate ODE's that preserve mass balance. Interventions that modify ODEs directly have no such guarantees.  As we explore additional queries in the ASKEM starter kit, we will likely need to represent interventions that directly modify the trajectories of the ODE's, which may result in further assumption violations. \n",
    "* **data complexity**.   Just as \"no plan has survived contact with the enemy\",  it may also be the case that \"no model has survived contact with data\". Unobserved confounding, missing data, and selection bias all threaten the validity of causal effect estimates.  Furthermore, when data come from different populations with different distributions over the same variables, care must be taken to avoid introducing bias.  By specifying queries that acknowledge these threats to validity, we can generate models that take these factors into account and apply formal causal reasoning to recover from the biases these threats may cause.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Scenario Ask: \n",
    "While perusing publications on Covid-19 models, you come across a model from early 2020 that was developed to describe the first Covid wave in Lombardy, Italy. You’re interested in updating this model for 2022, to include vaccinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before updating the model, you want to make sure you have a good understanding of the original model, can execute it, and reproduce the results in the publication describing the model. The paper doesn’t include code, but you think it’s feasible to create an executable version of the model and reproduce the results based on the model descriptions in the paper alone. The paper DOI is: [10.3389/fpubh.2020.00230](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00230/full). There are three ‘unit tests’ to ensure the model representation that we want to execute, is correct: Reproduce the results in Figs. 2A, 3A, and 3B\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. [Challenge] Ingest model and pass unit tests from publication alone (do not start with any code as input)\n",
    "    2. Ingest model and pass unit tests from publication and corresponding Code Version A \n",
    "    3. Ingest model and pass unit tests from publication and corresponding Code Version B \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Update the model from Question 1, to include vaccination. There are a number of ways to implement vaccination in an epidemiological model, but no matter the modeling approach, it should have an impact on one or more disease outcomes (e.g infections or deaths). Ensure your updated model is not the same as the model referenced in question 3a. Aside from these guidelines, there are no restrictions on modeling choices. If it is not clear how to update the model, do a small literature review/search, to understand how other published models account for vaccination.\n",
    "3. Model Comparison: \n",
    "\tIn addition to your updated model from Question 2 you are aware of the following two specific models that include vaccination\n",
    "\tYou find a publication that adds vaccination to the original model from question 1, at https://biomedres.us/pdfs/BJSTR.MS.ID.007413.pdf. (Please note the formatting error on pg. 4, where the first term in the equation for dS/dt should be μN)\n",
    "\tYou are also aware of the CHIME SVIIvR model (which adds vaccination to the original CHIME model, and was part of the starter kit)\n",
    "\tDo a structural model comparison between the models in questions 2, 3.a.i, and 3.a.ii. The structural comparison should include a summary or diagram describing similarities and differences between the models, with respect to parameters, variables/states, pathways, etc.\n",
    "\tCompare simulation outputs between the three models, for the following two scenarios.
